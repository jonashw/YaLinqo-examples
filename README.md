# Example uses of the YaLinqo library

- [YaLinqo](https://github.com/Athari/YaLinqo): Yet Another LINQ to Objects (for PHP)
- [Documentation](http://athari.github.io/YaLinqo)

I wanted to learn this library quickly so I read through the library docs, writing example `Enumerable` expressions as I went.

Why did I want to learn it?  Well, having used C# and F# extensively in the past, I am familiar with LINQ.  Recently, my team started to use Drupal (and PHP) for a big project; a LINQ-like library would help me work more efficiently with collections in PHP.

## Development Setup

1. `composer install`
2. `npm install`
3. `npm start`
